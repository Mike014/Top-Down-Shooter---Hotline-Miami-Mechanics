# Top-Down Shooter - Hotline Miami Mechanics

A personal project dedicated to experimenting with and replicating the core gameplay loop and high-octane mechanics of *Hotline Miami*.

## Experimental Features

* **Decoupled Aiming System:** A "Twin-Stick" style logic where aiming is entirely independent of movement.
* **Cursor-Driven Orientation:** Dynamic character rotation that tracks the mouse cursor position in real-time.
* **Input-Based Firing:** Responsive combat system triggered via mouse input.
* **Independent Locomotion:** WASD movement mapped to world coordinates, functioning regardless of the player's facing direction.
